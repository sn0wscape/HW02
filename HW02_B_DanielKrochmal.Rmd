## HW02 Part B

For this part of the HW, the goal is to try to recreate the graphs I make from scratch. I will only provide the MD, not the actual code I used to create it besides which data I use to create it. The rest will be up to you. 

Try for all 4, but if you are struggling don't worry about it. Try your best for each, if you don't get everything that's what the peer-review is for. :smile:


### Graph 1
```{r, echo = T, include = TRUE}
data("diamonds")
#hint think about the *position* the bars are in...
```


Using the diamonds dataset, make this graph:
```{r graph1 code, echo=FALSE}

#Create plot base and add main title
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes (x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("My Diamond Collection") +
  
  #Add title and subtitle
  labs(
    title = "My Diamond Collection",
    subtitle = "Boxplot representing the number of diamonds in my diamond collection by \ntype of cut quality and clarify of diamond"
  ) +
  
  #Rename x and y labels
  xlab("Diamond Cut") +
  ylab("Number of Diamonds") +
  
  #Center plot title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  
  #Add annotation  
  annotate("text", x = "Premium", y = 4500, label = "My Best Diamonds, \nof course")

```

### Graph 2
```{r, echo = T, include = TRUE}
data("iris")
```

Using the iris dataset, make this graph:
```{r graph 2 code, echo=FALSE}

#Create a new variable Species2 in the iris dataframe with re-ordered Species factors
iris$Species2 <- factor(iris$Species, levels = c("versicolor", "setosa", "virginica"))

#Create plot base
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species, group = Species, shape = Species)) +
  facet_wrap(~Species2, scales = "free_y") + #Group into facets based on newly created Species2 variable
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") #Add trendline

```


### Graph 3
You'll need the information in this first box to create the graph
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("mpg")
corvette <- mpg[mpg$model == "corvette",]
#install
require("ggrepel") #useful for making text annotations better, hint hint
set.seed(42)
```

Now using the mpg dataset and the corvette dataset, make this graph:

```{r graoh 3 code}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + # Create scatter plot layer based on an entire mpg dataset
  geom_point(data = corvette, aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") + # Create a second scatter plot layer with extracted corvette data
  labs(title = "Corvettes are a bit of an outlier") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 8), breaks = seq(1, 9, 1)) + #Adjust scales
  geom_text_repel(data = corvette, aes(x = displ, y = hwy), label = paste("Corvette", corvette$year)) #Add Corvette annotations
```

There is a trick to getting the model and year to print off together. `paste()` is a useful function for this, also pasting together parts of file names and parts of urls together. 


### Graph 4 
```{r, echo = T}
data(mpg)

#hint for the coloring, colorbrewer and you can set palette colors and make your graphs colorblind friendly
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = T) #take a look at the colorblindfriendly options
```

The above graph lets you see some colobrlind friendly palettes. For the graph below, I used Set2.



Now using the above mpg dataset, make this graph

```{r graph 4 code}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = cty)) +
  
  #Add first boxplot layer
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
  
  #Add second scatter plot layer with color aesthetic mapped onto class
  geom_point(aes(color = class), position = position_jitter(height = 0)) +
  
  #Apply palette coloring and flip the axes
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  coord_flip() +
  
  #Add title and axis labels
  ggtitle("Horizontal BoxPlot of City MPG and Car Class") +
  xlab("Car class") +
  ylab("City mpg")
```
